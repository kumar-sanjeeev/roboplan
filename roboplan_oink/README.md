## Acknowledgments

This project is inspired by and adapts code and concepts from the following fantastic open-source libraries:
- [Pink](https://github.com/stephane-caron/pink) by Stéphane Caron.
- [Placo](https://github.com/Rhoban/placo) by Marc Duclusaud, Grégoire Passault, Vincent Padois and Olivier Ly.
